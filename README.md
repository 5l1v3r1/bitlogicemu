# The intention of this POC is to provide the internals of a MIPS microprocesor architecrure 
# pure implemented in boole logic, avoiding python internal control structures like
# if,while,for,etc and atomic data types where posible. 
# But there is a catch, how we can implement feedback without recursion.
